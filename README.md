## WebTV Build 7383 (v2.5.6im Internal Non-debug)

This build supports **MSN Messenger**, but **REMOVES** MOD/XM/S3M and Karaoke.

This ROM is *patched* to automatically boot into our custom HTML and can be used offline. The patch hooks into Power Off Code **77437**, therefore replacing **client:gotoadvancedsetup**, which has been renamed to **client:gotohacktv**

**[rommy](https://github.com/wtvemac/rommy)** is required to build the ROM.
